## 💡 LED Color Guide

The RGB LEDs show drone orientation:

- 🔴 **Front** = Red
- 🟢 **Back** = Green  
- 🔵 **Right** = Blue
- 🟡 **Left** = Yellow

Instant orientation awareness!

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Will this affect the ML model?
**A:** No! These are purely visual improvements. The physics simulation and ML predictions remain unchanged.

### Q: Is performance affected?
**A:** No! Still runs at 60 FPS. The geometry is optimized.

### Q: Can I customize the colors?
**A:** Yes! Edit the color values in `simulation.py` in the `create_drone_model()` method.

### Q: Do I need to retrain the model?
**A:** No! This is a visual-only change.

### Q: Where's the code?
**A:** All in `python/simulation.py`. Search for `create_drone_model()`.
